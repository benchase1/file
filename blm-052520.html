<p>Black Lives Matter<br>
May 25, 2020</p>

<p>Today, in Minneapolis, Minnesota, United States, a man by the name of George Floyd was killed by local police officers. (This is in the news, so I won't go into much detail.)</p>

<p>Since the channel started in 2014 (and since I was born in 2003), myself and my videos have shown support for everyone, no matter what race (or gender. wealth, education, etc.) they are.
I have witnessed police brutality myself, and it is not fair what happens to people with a different race than themselves.
The United States has had a long history of discrimination towards Black people, and I do not support this.</p>
